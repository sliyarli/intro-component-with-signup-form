## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to implement form validation in JavaScript. I also practiced using flexbox for layout design.

### Continued development

I plan to continue improving my JavaScript skills and exploring more advanced form validation techniques. Additionally, I want to enhance my knowledge of CSS for better styling.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web) - This resource provides comprehensive documentation on web technologies and was helpful for understanding JavaScript form validation.
